#React Hot Loader 3 Attempt

To set up and run, execute `npm install` then `npm run dev`.

To see hot reloading fail, try editing the source from an active component from `src/js/containers/` - initially `App.js` or `Home.js`.

If the page doesn't launch automatically, it can be found at `localhost:8080`.
